### Install Node with:

```
brew install node 
```
or whatever else you got, just install node please

### Run locally with:

i don't know anything about node, this may not be **the** way, but will work (probably)

not sure if you need these, since they have files in `node_modules` already, if `node index.js` throws errors, just install these to be sure
```
npm i @xenova/transformers
npm i wavefile 
```

```
node index.js
```
